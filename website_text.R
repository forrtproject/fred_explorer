                   A: The FORRT Replication Database is open and shared under a CC-By Attribution 4.0 International license. Please cite us (see About-tab) if you use these resources. Reach out to us if you want to code a moderator and maybe we can join forces (some moderators have already been coded for parts of the data). Also, we are happy about feedback or knowing that other people can make use of this project!"
                   , "<h4><br/><br/><b>Q: How is this project related to FORRT's replications and reversals? Should I enter my study in both places?</b><br/>
                   A: This project is independent of FORRT's replications and reversals. Whereas FORRT focuses on research topics, we focus on individual replications. ReD is actively collaborating with FORRT and we plan to merge both databases, thus you do not need to enter your results in both places. However, we do not know yet when a synthesis will be possible, so we encourage you to join both projects."

                   A: Both ways are possible. If it is possible for you, please enter the effect sizes as differentiated as possible. This will facilitate future analyses and better allow researchers, to determine how to successfully replicate prior research. If entering the results on an item-by-item basis is not possible for some reason, we are still very happy about you entering an aggregated effect size. In this case, please write into the note-variable, that more fine-graind results are available."
                   , "<h4><br/><br/><b>Q: What is the data strucure? Can you account for dependent studies? Can there be multiple results for a single study?</b><br/>
                   A: Yes, we do account for multilevel structure / dependent effect sizes. Check out the Figure below for an in-depth explanation.<br/>"
